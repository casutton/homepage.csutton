* *September 2018*: I have moved to Mountain View as a
research scientist at Google Brain! I maintain
an affiliation at the University of Edinburgh
and my research group at Edinburgh is still doing amazing work!
* *August 2017*: We are starting an exciting new project on
[Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/) at the Alan Turing Institute. Co-investigators are with Chris Williams (Edinburgh), Zoubin Ghahramani (Cambridge), and Ian Horrocks (Oxford). Please get in touch if you would like to know more or to collaborate.
* *July 2017*: I have finally been able to publish my old code
for [probabilistic inference in queueing networks](https://github.com/casutton/bayes-qnet)
onto Github. This is the code from Sutton and Jordan, 2011, Annals of Applied Statistics.
