<h1>Advice about Research Posters</h1>

<p>
Posters are an important form of scientific communication,
and you will make many posters over the course of your career.
There are two parts to a poster presentation: <em>designing</em>
the poster before the meeting, and <em>presenting</em> it once you are
there. Here is some advice that I have collected to help with each
step.
</p>

<h2>Designing a Poster</h2>
<p>
Here is some <a href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/igs/phd/fees-funding/poster-printing">good general advice on posters</a> from
some Informatics students. Includes advice about how to print posters locally.
</p>
<p>
Here is some other <a href="https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/HowTowiki/Designing+an+academic+poster+-+1.+Getting+started">all around advice</a> on presenting an academic poster.
</p>
<p>
For advice at a more philosophical level about how
a poster is used in communication, see

</p>
<p>
This <a href="http://betterposters.blogspot.co.uk">blog about scientific posters</a>
has some amazing examples as well as critiques that show the process of posters being improved.
NOTE: Some of the examples on this blog are probably better designed than any poster I have ever personally seen
in a decade of attending conferences.
</p>
<p>
As for the mechanics, here are <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/student-services/graduate-school/for-students/training-and-development/Powerpoint%20to%20Create%20Posters%20at%20KB%20COPY%20SHOP%202013.pdf">tips on how to use PowerPoint for posters</a>. Back when I made posters, I found that PowerPoint was OK but had some annoying features.  Lots of people use LaTeX which works well, although I prefer specialized desktop publishing
software.
</p>
<p>
Some other suggested pages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <code>beamerposter</code> template is a popular option for LaTeX posters. Here is another <a href="http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/">LaTeX poster template</a> with some nice examples. Within
  Informatics a lot of people use the <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/systems/tex/infposter/">infposter</a>
  class with LaTeX</li>
  <li>Some <a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/posters">short and good</a> advice from NYU.
</ul>  
<h2>Presenting a Poster</h2>
<p>
One more point that I'd like to make that I didn't see above.
We often talk about "<b>a</b> poster presentation," but this is misleading.
In fact, you use your poster for many different presentations,
depending on who you are talking to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 3-5 minute presentation for people who don't have a specific background in your line of research.
  <li>The 1 minute + 10 minutes questions version that you give to the world expert in your subarea. In this case you skip all of the stuff that they already know, and focus on the key part that is new.
  <li>The people who read your poster on their own: either because you are presenting to another person,
  you have stepped away to get a drink or see other posters, or because they just prefer to read the
  text before talking to you.
</ul>
<p>
You want your poster to work for all three types of presentations. I like to have enough text
on the poster that it can be read usefully if I'm not around, but enough tables and equations
that I can give a presentation that ignores all of the text. But not too much text.
Your text should be big and simple. You should not copy sentences from your paper;
these sentences will usually be too complex.
Your poster should have strong visuals.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that your presentation should be an interactive discussion. Sometimes you will be talking
to one or two people, and sometimes a crowd. If only a few people, watch them closely to judge
when you should give more detail and when you should speed up.
</p>
<p>
Also, the easiest way to proofread a poster is to print it in colour on a sheet of A3 paper.
As an American, I  find ISO paper sizes to be particularly refreshing here.
