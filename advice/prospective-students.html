<h1>For Prospective Students</h1>

<p>
I expect to take on 1-2 new PhD students for the academic year 2017/8.
There are lots of exciting  research projects in my group.
I am interested in statistical machine learning, probabilistic
graphical models, approximate inference, and applications of machine
learning, including applications to performance data from computer
systems, to programming languages, and to natural language processing.
I work in between theory and practice: I look for new applications of machine learning,
especially in computer science and engineering, that push the boundaries of existing
  methodology and suggest new methods.
  </p><p>
Here are some examples of areas in which I could accept students:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><em>Using machine learning to make programming better:</em> I'm very excited by the potential for applying machine learning and natural
  language processing ideas to computer programs. The idea is to find patterns
  in large corpora of open source software that characterize well
  written code that is easy to read. Another direction is to apply machine learning
  methods to program semantics, e.g., learning when the state of a program is unusual,
  e.g., in terms of values and variables etc. There are lots of interesting applications
  to program maintenance and debugging. To get a sense of the type of work that we do,
  here is a <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/publications-by-topic.html#software%20engineering">our papers in machine learning and software engineering</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>Using machine learning to make machine learning better:</em> Data analysis is a long process that includes data cleaning, visualizing, applying a machine learning method,
  evaluating the performance of an algorithm, and monitoring it over time.  Most research in machine learning
  focuses only on the one step in the middle --- how to build a good model --- but the other steps are themselves
  ripe applications for machine learning methods. Interesting problems here include data cleaning and
  interactive machine learning.</p>
  <li><p><em>Deep learning.</em> Recently we have begun developing and applying new neural network models (see here for examples of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/publications-by-topic.html#neural%20networks">papers related to neural networks</a>).
  I think that there are a lot of interesting potential directions on new types of deep architectures
  for unsupervised learning.</p>
 <li><p>Other applications of interest in our group  include computer security, sustainable energy, natural language processing, and learning analytics.</p></li>
  <li><p>I also welcome students to propose their own potential projects
in my areas of interest. My supervising style is fairly flexible;
I believe that it is important that we work together to tailor
the project to match your interests.</p></li>
</ul>

<b>If you'd like work with me as a PhD student,</b>
<a href="mailto:csutton@inf.ed.ac.uk">send me an email</a>
before you apply. Think about what kind of research you want to do
and why you want to work with me.
Please include a CV and a summary of your marks in relevant courses.
</p>
<p>
<b>To get a sense of my research,</b>
read a few of <a href="publications.html">my recent
papers</a>. Ask yourself if you'd like to write papers that look like those. 
</p>
<p>
<b>To apply</b>, read the pages about
<a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/postgraduate/apply.html">how to apply for graduate study</a>
at the School of Informatics web site.
Applications are accepted throughout the spring term, but for overseas
students I would advise that you apply by December for entry the
following September,
 because this will maximise your
potential sources of funding. The official deadline is given 
at the link above.
</p>
<p>You have <b>two main options</b>: a ``direct PhD'' or the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Data Science.</p>

<p> First, the <a href="http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Doctoral
Training in Data Science</a> is a 4 year PhD programme that includes a classroom component, so you can apply
to the Centre directly from a bachelor's degree. Topics covered by the Centre include machine learning,
databases, natural language processing, statistics and optimization, and other areas.
</p>
<p>
Second, the <b>direct PhD</b> is a 3 year programme with no coursework component.
It is suitable if you already have experience in machine learning or natural language processing.
Because the PhD is quite short,  unless you already have a strong
background in machine learning, I would encourage you to
do an MSc first, in order to gain the necessary background
before applying directly to the PhD.
You could consider <a
href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/postgraduate/msc">MSc
programme</a> in the School of Informatics, and in particular
the <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/postgraduate/lfd/">Learning from
Data</a> specialism.
</p>
<p>
If you are an <b>overseas student</b>, you should be aware that funding is quite limited.
If you are able to obtain a scholarship from your home country, that will help significantly.
If you require funding from us, then you should apply either for the Edinburgh Global Scholarship
or (if you are Chinese) for the China Scholarship Council Award. <b>These require a separate application
from your application for PhD entry.</b> Both of these awards are very competitive, so you will need to
be a top student to have a realistic chance of winning one.  Please see this page for more
<a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/postgraduate/fees/scholarshipsoverseas">information
about scholarships for overseas students.</a>
</p>
<p>
Finally, here is some great <a href="http://graddecision.org">general advice for applying</a> to graduate school in computer science.
It is somewhat US-centric, although some of the same principles will apply over here as well.
