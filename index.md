<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
My research concerns a broad range of applications of probabilistic methods
for machine learning, including software engineering, natural language processing,
computer security, queueing theory, and sustainable energy.
Although these applications are disparate, they are connected by
an underlying statistical methodology in probabilistic modelling
and techniques for approximate inference in graphical models.
</p><p>
My research strategy is based on the idea that sufficiently difficult applications
motive the development of new methodology.  I aim to develop new machine learning
methods based on this interplay of theory and practice.
</p><p>
I am part of a large   	  <a href="http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=184&amp;Itemid=398">machine learning group</a> at Edinburgh.
Here is some <a href="advice/prospective-students.html">information for prospective students</a> in the group.
</p><p>
My position is funded through <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/">the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance</a>.
  </p>

<h2>Recent Publications</h2>

<p>
Please see my  <b><a href="publications.html">full list of publications</a></b>,
or my list of  <b><a href="publications-by-topic.html">publications, sorted by topic</a></b>.

<p>
Here are a few recent highlights:

<p>
Finally, I have a collection of brief, tutorial-style <a href="notes/">research
notes</a> (very old).

<h2 id="group">Research Group</h2>

<p>I collaborate with a wonderful group of students and researchers
who have, for whatever reason, chosen to go under the
name <a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/cup">CUP: Charles's Uncertain People</a>.
We have a weekly reading group,
to which all are welcome.</p>

<p>
A subgroup of CUP, called <a href="http://mast-group.github.io/">MAST (Machine learning for the Analysis of Source code Text)</a>, focuses
on machine learning for software engineering and programming languages.
Our software in this area is available via the <a href="https://github.com/mast-group/">MAST Github group</a>.
</p>


<h3>Members of my research group</h3>

<h2>Advisors, Mentors, Collaborators</h2>

<ul>
	<li>My graduate advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum">Andrew McCallum</a> at the <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>.</li>     
	<li> I did a postdoc at the
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>
working with  <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/">Michael I. Jordan</a>. I also collaborated with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/">Dave Patterson</a>,
		<a href="http://bnrg.eecs.berkeley.edu/~randy/">Randy Katz</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fox/">Armando Fox</a>, and <a href="http://bnrg.cs.berkeley.edu/~adj/">Anthony Joseph</a> in networking and systems.
I participated in the <a href="http://radlab.cs.berkeley.edu/">RAD Lab</a>, which focused on issues in the design and
management of data center applications.</li>
	<li>I worked as a intern at Microsoft Research with <a href="https://research.microsoft.com/~minka/">Tom Minka</a>.</li>
	<li>Other collaborators include Earl Barr (UCL), Zoubin Ghahramani (Cambridge), Max Welling (University of Amsterdam), Chris Pal (Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal), Khashayar Rohanimanesh (UMass), Yanlei Diao (Ecole Polytechnique), Prashant Shenoy (UMass), Hanna Wallach (Microsoft Research), Peter Bodik (Microsoft Research), Rob Hall (TripAdvisor), Michael Sindelar (Uber).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>
Hobbies: I live with cats and fish, who don't interact as much as you
might think. I've played a few computer games,
mostly adventure games and RPGs. I play Go (圍棋, 囲碁, 바둑).
If you would like to know where to play Go in person, try
<a href="http://www.usgo.org/">the American Go Association</a>
or <a href="https://www.britgo.org">the British Go Association</a>.
I enjoy cooking.
</p>
<p>
When I was in university, I was a bit sillier than I am now, so I
created a <a href="http://al.oysi.us/">silly web site called al.oysi.us</a>.
The URL is easy to remember, because as I'm sure you're aware, Aloysius is my middle name.
Warning: May not suitable for the silliness-challenged.
