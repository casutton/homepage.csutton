<h1>Machine Learning Specialism FAQ</h1>

<p>
Here is some informal advice from me (Charles Sutton) about the Machine Learning specialism,
which is part of the MSc programme in the School of Informatics,
University of Edinburgh. 
</p>

<h3>What classes should I take?</h3>

<p>
 The <a href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/students/taught-msc-2016/programme-guide/specialist-areas/machine-learning">specialism web site</a> gives some advice on course selection.
Following this advice is a good way to get a sensible selection of courses.
However, you should only pick courses for which you have the pre-requisites,
and there can be good reasons to consider options outside the specialism table.
The courses listed in the specialism are advice, but they are not strict requirements.
The strict requirements that
your courses  need to satisfy are the <a
href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/16-17/dpt/drps_inf.htm#ptList">DPT rules for your
degree</a>.
</p>
<p>
In Semester 1, MLPR and IAML cover some of the same material,
so you shouldn't normally take both courses at the same
time. IAML is primarily intended to prepare you to use a variety of machine
learning methods, and spends time going through the application of some methods that MLPR will only mention.
In contrast, MLPR spends more time on mathematical detail, and is intended for
those who wish to be involved in core machine learning research in future. The
<a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/">MLPR website</a> gives
details of its mathematical pre-requisites.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to participate in the specialism, my personal
 advice is:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you are serious about machine learning, and have the background,
        take MLPR and PMR. If you don't take these courses, you will not
      be prepared to do a summer project in developing new ML methods.</li>
   <li>If you do not have the mathematical background for MLPR, take IAML
       instead, which would prepare you for more applied ML projects.</li>
   <li>PMR has similar mathematical requirements to MLPR, but can still be taken after
       IAML instead of MLPR. You can re-evaluate at the beginning of Semester 2 whether you
       should take PMR.</li>
   <li>MLP is a practical course that develops skills in implementing and
       running machine learning methods. It is set up as a series of projects
       rather than formal lectures, so it will not give you an overview of the
field, and it does not replace either IAML or MPLR.
       If you decide to take MLP, you should take it in addition to one of IAML and MLPR.</li>
    <li>
Consider taking DME if you would like to learn about examples
        of applying advanced machine learning methods to various problems.</li>
   <li>Reinforcement learning is another area of machine learning
that has become increasingly active over the past few years,
e.g., with high-profile successes at Google DeepMind.</li>
  <!--
    <li>Consider taking IT if you would like to learn about a
  beautiful mathematical theory that underlies
  how telecommunications works, and how compression algorithms work,
  and how machine learning works.</li>
  -->
  <li>Randomness and Computation is a theory course (more mathematical than
      MLPR and PMR), which could be
      useful background for those interested in the theoretical end of machine
      learning.</li>
    <li>Also consider taking an outside course in statistics if you would like
  additional theoretical background that will help you in further
  study of machine learning, especially if you are considering a PhD
 someday. Please see the FAQ below about statistics courses.
   <li>You can also consider taking courses in the databases
      specialism, as in your working life it will often help you to
      know the theory behind databases.
   <li>The Extreme Computing course is also especially popular and relevant.
   <li>Then fill out your programme with courses in other research
 areas that apply machine learning, such as natural language
 processing, speech processing,
      bioinformatics, computer vision, graphics, or robotics.
The Social and Technical Networks course is another 
course that is relevant to a lot of the types of modern applications
used in machine learning.
  </ol>

<h3> 
  <h3>What programming background should I have?</h3>

<p>
  You should be able to program in a language like Java, C++, Python,
  etc. If you do not have this background, you should take the
  Introduction to Java course. 
</p>
<!--  <p>You do not need a background in Prolog for the specialism.
     We do not require you to take the Logic Programming course,
     and we do not recommend that you take it unless you have a particular
     interest in the subject matter. 
  </p> -->
  
<h3>How much maths do I need?</h3>

<p>
  Some students find the maths used in PMR and MLPR to be a bit hard
  going. This seems to happen especially to students with a computer
  science background, because most of CS uses discrete maths, whereas
  machine learning tends to need continuous maths, especially calculus
  and linear algebra. For this reason, students with a physics or engineering
  background sometimes have less trouble.
</p>
<p>
  Both the 
  <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/">MLPR</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pmr/">PMR</a>
  course pages describe the maths background we expect</a>.
</p>

<h3>Can I take courses from outside Informatics?</h3>

<p>
  Yes, you may wish to consider taking a course or two from the
  Statistics/OR programme because of the close relationships between
  statistics and ML. This is especially relevant if you are
  considering a PhD in machine learning someday.
  </p>
  <p>If you wish to consider this, please see this page with
   <a
  href="http://msc.maths.ed.ac.uk/sor/study-programme">general
information about the statistics/OR programme</a>.
Also, you should read
<a href="https://msctimetable.maths.ed.ac.uk/timetable.php?program=1&semester=13">this timetable</a>
carefully because their programme is set up very differently
  than ours. For example, they have several 5-credit courses.
</p>
<p>
  Based on their topics the following classes would be especially relevant:
<ol>
<li>MATH11085 STh Statistical Theory
<li>MATH11006 MP Mathematical Programming
<li>MATH11029 SM Stochastic Modelling
</ol>
<p>
The timetable for the OR part is weekly, and set up very differently
from Informatics. You need to check the timetables carefully.
</p>
<p>
The OR courses have a cap on their class sizes because it is a very
large programme. Before you take any OR courses, you need to contact
the OR Programme Director (currently Dr Julian Hall &lt; J.A.J.Hall @ ed.ac.uk &gt;).
Before you take any statistics courses, you need to contact
the Statistics Programme Director (currently
 Dr Bruce Worton &lt; b.worton @ ed.ac.uk &gt;)
to receive permission.
</p>
<p>
There is one unexpected interaction to keep in mind:
<b>If the total of your Levels 9-10 Informatics credits and your credits
  from outside Informatics adds up to more than 30 points</b>,
  then you are in a special case where you need to talk to
  your Personal Tutor for advice.
<b>This is very important.</b>
</p>

<h3>I can't fit 5 courses from the official list. Is that OK?</h3>

<p>
  Yes, this is fine. The specialism guidelines are advisory and not
  strict requirements. If you are unsure about your program, email or
  speak to your personal tutor for advice.
</p>

<h3>If I do this specialism, will I get a job? Will it use machine learning?</h3>

<p>
  I don't know. There are a couple reasons why I don't know.
  First, I don't know you, or how skilled you are.
  Second, and more fundamentally, as a lecturer, I know how to get a teaching job in academia&mdash;that's the job I have, after all.
  It has been many years since I tried to get a job in the computer industry.
</p>
<p>
  Really I can say only two things: First, overall in Informatics, my
  impression is that our MSc graduates do reasonably well in the job
  market. Second, there are lots of companies in industry that use or
  want to use machine learning. 
</p>
<h3>Does this page have a disclaimer?</h3>
<p>
Why yes, it does. Although I have taught many of the courses in the
specialism, this page is not the official School regulations.
In particular, I may not update this page every time
the School regulations are updated (I'll try my best, though).
Therefore, if you see an official School page that appears to conflict
with this page, the official School page is probably right.
In case of any doubt on regulations, please contact the ITO. If you
wish to discuss your course selections, please talk to your Personal Tutor.
