<h1>Research-ish Notes</h1>

<p>
Inspired by the example of 
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/writing/">Jason 
Rennie</a>, I wrote some short notes to help me learn background
during my PhD.  Generally, these are 2- or 3-page 
simple notes that answer a question either about my work
or someone else's.  Others of these describe implementation
tricks that may be
useful for efficiently reproducing my or others' results.
They are pretty old now, but perhaps they are still useful
to someone.
