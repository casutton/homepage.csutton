# Software From Our Research

* Much of the code from the software engineering work in our group
  is available via our GitHub group on
  <a href="https://mast-group.github.io">Machine Learning for Source
  Code Text</a>.

* I have contributed to <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/">MALLET</a>,
a Java package for machine learning on text.  MALLET includes implementations 
of several classification algorithms, conditional random fields,
and latent Dirichlet allocation.

* I have also written <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/grmm/index.php">GRMM</a>, a Java toolkit for inference in graphical models
with discrete variables.  It includes facilities for easily constructing and
training CRFs with arbitrary graphical structure.  I have used it to produce
results for several of my papers, including those on DCRFs and skip-chain CRFs.

## Other Projects

For more "fun" projects (not that fun, sorry), see [my Github page](https://github.com/casutton/).

Maybe you're particularly interested in (the source for this site)[].

## Software I Use

I enjoy playing around with "productivity" software.
