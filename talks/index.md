Research Talks
=====

Here are "companion web pages" to some research seminars that I have recently presented.
Each web page below contains slides, code, links to papers, and a bullet point abstract.

Like most academics, I have several slide decks that I re-use for different audiences,
with slight modifications for each version. If I posted each modified version
as a separate entry, it would clutter this list. To avoid this, I only keep
the most recent version up on this page, so the slides you see here may
be slightly different from the ones I presented.

## More about Philosophy

This collection is a recent experiment on my part, inspired by a famous essay
from Edward Tufte. [Find out more about the philosophy behind the experiment.](http://www.theexclusive.org/2016/12/on-creating-companion-web-site-for-talks.html)
