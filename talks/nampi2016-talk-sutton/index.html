	  <h3>TL;CE <span class="header-parenthetical">(too long; checked email)</span></h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Exciting opportunity: Every aspect of practical software development can be improved by ML tools
	    <li>Hot topic in software engineering and programming languages: "big code" or "naturalness of software"
	    <li>Want to create neural networks that have semantic understanding of code
	    <li>Wait? Isn't program semantics a solved problem? Two answers
	    <ol>
	      <li>Not if you include the connection to the problem domain
	      <li>Not if you want an approximate method that works for common cases
	    </ol>
	    <li>One way to show that you understand software is to summarize it: Given a Java method body, what is the name?
	    <li>Our ICML 2016 paper does this with a novel three-way convolutional attention mechanism
	    <li>In more recent work, we have looked at mapping symbolic expressions to continuous semantics
	    We want the semantics to retain information about equivalence
	    <li>Tree-based networks seem natural here, but they tend to key on syntactic similarity rather than semantic
	    <li>Our method is called <em>equivalence networks</em> (EqNets)
	    <li>We add a regularization term, <em>subexpression forcing,</em> that requires that child semantics be predictable from parents and siblings. This is inpsired by what happens in symbolic logics via, e.g., unification.
	    <li>Sequence-to-sequence, tree neural networks, etc., do not work well for this problem, but subexpression forcing gives a big improvement.

	  <h3>Why Am I Doing This?</h3>
	  <p>
	  I was inspired to create a "companion web site" for this talk
	  by <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint">Tufte's quixotic diatribe
	  against Powerpoint</a>. He recommends written handouts instead. This is a first attempt
	  to adapt his idea to an all-open all-Internet all-the-time age. Feedback welcome.
